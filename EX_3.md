## EX 3.1

A mass of $200\;g$ of saturated liquid water is completely vaporized at a constant pressure of $100\;kPa$

Determine (a) the volume change and (b) the amount of energy transferred to the water

### (a)

according to the properties of the phase transition, we can get the information from the table

$$
v_f = 0.001043\qquad v_g = 1.6941\\[2ex]
\begin{aligned}
    v_{fg} &= v_g - v_f = 1.693057\\[2ex]
    V &= mv_{fg}\\[2ex]
      &= 0.2 \times 1.693057 = 0.3386 m^3
\end{aligned}
$$

### (b)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E &= m h_{fg}\\[2ex]
      &= 0.2\times 2257.5 = 451.5kJ
\end{aligned}
$$

## EX 3.2

A rigid tank contains 10 kg of water at 90Â°C. If 8 kg of the water is in the liquid form and the rest is in the vapor form

Determine (a) the pressure in the tank and (b) the volume of the tank.

### (a)

according to the properties of the saturated water, the pressure of the saturating water remains the same.

Finding the table on the table A-4 on p.904

$$
P_{sat} = 70.183\;kPa
$$

### (b)

Finding the same data in the table A-4 on p.904

$$
\begin{aligned}
    V &= m_g\cdot v_g+m_f\cdot v_f\\[2ex]
      &= 2\times 2.3593+8\times 0.001036\\[2ex]
      &= 4.7269 m^3
\end{aligned}
$$

## EX 3.3

Determine the mass os the air in a room whose dimensions are $4\;m\times5\;m\times6\;m$ at $100\;kPa$ and $25^\circ C$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    PV &= mRT\\[2ex]
    m &= \frac{PV}{RT}\\[2ex]
      &= \frac{100\;kPa\times 120\; m^3}{0.2870\;kJ/kg\cdot K \times (25+273)K}\\[2ex]
      &= 140.31\;kg
\end{aligned}
$$
